        <p>My name is Kashish, and I am a second-year Data Science student at Northeastern University. I have lived in Massachusetts my entire life, and it has shaped much of who I am today. My academic journey is fueled by my passion for math and data, as I enjoy finding patterns, analyzing information, and solving complex problems. Along with my studies, I have a deep passion for dance, particularly Bollywood, Hip Hop, and Bhangra.

            Dancing has been an integral part of my life, allowing me to express myself while staying active and connected to my culture. I am part of NU Junoon, a competitive dance team at Northeastern University, where I train and perform with a talented group of dancers. Being on the team has helped me develop discipline, teamwork, and confidence, both on and off the stage.
            
            Beyond academics and dance, I am always eager to learn new things and challenge myself. Whether itâ€™s exploring data science applications, improving my public speaking skills, or pushing my limits in dance, I strive to grow in every aspect of life. I look forward to new opportunities that allow me to blend my analytical skills with my creativity./p>
